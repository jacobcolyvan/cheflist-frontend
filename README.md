# Cheflist Frontend Repository
Deployed Project: https://cheflist.netlify.app/login <br>

This is a frontend of a project completed using the MERN stack with @andrewtrandev, for our final project with CoderAcademy.

### Description
It is a website that lets you search recipes by key ingredients. After selecting a recipe a Spotify playlist relevant to the recipe will be generated, this can be saved to the user account. The user will be asked some questions to gauge mood and disposition, this will help the playlist generator in creating a playlist that is relevant and engaging. The recipes and playlists are saved securely on the site so that they can be accessed at any time.
